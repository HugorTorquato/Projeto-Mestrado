abstract = {This paper presents a detailed feasibility study and techno-economic evaluation of a standalone hybrid solar–wind system with battery energy storage for a remote island. The solar radiation and wind data on this island in 2009 was recorded for this study. The HOMER software was employed to do the simulations and perform the techno-economic evaluation. Thousands of cases have been carried out to achieve an optimal autonomous system configuration, in terms of system net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE). A detailed analysis, description and expected performance of the proposed system were presented. Moreover, the effects of the PV panel sizing, wind turbine sizing and battery bank capacity on the system’s reliability and economic performance were examined. Finally, a sensitivity analysis on its load consumption and renewable energy resource was performed to evaluate the robustness of economic analysis and identify which variable has the greatest impact on the results. The results demonstrate the techno-economic feasibility of implementing the solar–wind–battery system to supply power to this island.}
